### Autofill success! üéâ

Autofill log:


$(cat $log | sed 's/^/>/g;s/ÔøΩ\[32m//g;s/ÔøΩ\[0m//g')


Download the attempted autofilled library file by pressing [this link]($(echo $artefact_url)).

You can now fill in the remainder of the columns, and append to the end of the corresponding library file.
Please remember this service attempts to pull relevant metadata from the ENA, but metadata is not always correct!

> [!WARNING]
> Always check accuracy of pre-filled columns before adding to the library table!

### Something went wrong üò¢

Please check your previous request (correct table, project ID etc.).

Autofill log:

$(cat $log | sed 's/^/>/g;s/ÔøΩ\[32m//g;s/ÔøΩ\[0m//g')

Note request should be in format:
\`@spaam-bot please autofill <table> <project_id>\`

Where table corresponds to an AncientMetagenomeDir, and project_id corresponds to the project_id you have added in your samples table (requires exact match!)

If error isn't self explandatory please report on the #ancientmetagenomedir channel on the SPAAM slack.
Include the following URL: https://github.com/SPAAM-community/AncientMetagenomeDir/actions/runs/$(echo $run_id)
